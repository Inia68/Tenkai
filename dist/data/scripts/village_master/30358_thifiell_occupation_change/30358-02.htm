A change of profession occurs when someone with the required abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced
profession. Unfortunately, you cannot change your profession here. However, I can give you some information. Dark
Mystics like yourself can change profession to become a <font color="LEVEL">Dark Wizard</font> or a <font color="LEVEL">Shillien
    Oracle</font>. Which profession do you want to learn about?
