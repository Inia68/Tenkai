Head Blacksmith Bronk:
<br>
To change profession means that you have attained a certain degree of ability and experience, and may be promoted to a
higher-level profession. You cannot change profession here, however I can give you some information. If you are a
Dwarven Fighter, you can change profession to become an <font color="LEVEL">Artisan</font> or a <font color="LEVEL">Scavenger</font>.
Which profession do you want to know about?
