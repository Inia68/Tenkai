To change profession means that you have attained a certain degree of ability and experience, and may be promoted to a
higher-level profession. Orc Fighters can change profession to an <font color="LEVEL">Raider</font> or a <font
        color="LEVEL">Monk</font>. Which profession do you want to know about?
