Some nightmarish images are tormenting me while i'm asleep, yes. Many days have passed and these mysterious dreams seem
to have no end. If i could gather the elements needed to perform a ritual, with no doubt i would be able to understand
what future is trying to tell me in that disturbing way.<br><br>
