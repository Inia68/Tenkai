What an achievement! I am truly in awe of you and your cohorts. Now, let me give you something in recognition of your
work. It's not much, compared to your great accomplishments, but I have a chest containing the strength of Istina's soul
stone.
The soul stone itself sometimes changes materials. Please, accept this with our thanks.<br>
