<body>Today's Tip:<br>There can be problems with progressing through a quest when your inventory is filled to over 90%
or if the weight is over 80% of the maximum limit. Remove items from the inventory to have at least 10% of free space
and drop the weight to below 80%, and then speak to the NPC again. <br><br><br>
