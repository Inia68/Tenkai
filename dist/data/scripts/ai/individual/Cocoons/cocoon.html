Cocoon:
<br>
You can see... many fairy citizens are being changed within these... cocoons, but it's not too late... to stop them!
Attack the cocoons, while they are still forming, and you will destroy them.
<br>
Otherwise, you can promote the mutation by injecting <font color="LEVEL">Glimmer</font> into them channel where
nutrients are supplied.
<br>
( To use <font color="LEVEL">Glimmer</font> , target a cocoon and click Glimmer. To attack the cocoon, initiate an
attack while pressing the Ctrl key. For a powerful attack, use your skills.)
