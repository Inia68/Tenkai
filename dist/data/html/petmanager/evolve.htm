Depending on its type, you may be able to evolve your pet. Evolution is only possible when the pet is summoned. Also,
since the process transfers the experience value, evolving a high level pet might actually result in a decrease in the
pet's level.<br>
Any items in the pet's inventory will be transferred to the owner's inventory.<br>
Which pet do you want to evolve?<br>
