<body>Trader Carson:<br>
Welcome, customer! Is there anything specific that you're looking for today? We have a wide selection of earrings,
necklaces, rings and more. In fact, I daresay that we have any accessory worth having. That's the difference between
Elmore and Aden, eh? Here in Aden, we believe elegance is always worth the price -- not like those savages to the north!
Well, have a look around. Whatever your budget, I'm sure you'll find something that pleases you.<br>
