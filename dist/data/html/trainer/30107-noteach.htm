<body>Master Goldian:<br>
The swordsmanship techniques I teach can only be mastered by Elves who have dedicated themselves to a lifetime of
precise, graceful movement. Humans are too rough, and Orcs are even worse! And wizards can barely hold a blade in front
of them!<br>
Go find a teacher from whose teachings you can really benefit.
