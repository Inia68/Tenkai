<body>Magister Rovia:<br>
Welcome! My fellow Magisters and I were dispatched to the Ivory Tower of Oren in order to instruct Giran's finest youths
in the ways of magic.<br>
It looks like you're from a small country school. Did you study at Einhovant's School of Magic? Hmmph! I wonder if you
were even taught the basics correctly! I'm a little worried that you won't be able to keep up with my lessons,
but...<br>
Well, let's just get started and see how you do. If you don't understand something, don't feel embarrassed to ask.<br>
