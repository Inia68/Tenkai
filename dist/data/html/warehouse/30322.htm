<body>Warehouse Keeper Balcon:<br>
Welcome, youngster. You look like you're making decent money these days, eh? Maybe you should consider storing some of
your valuables here at the Iron Gate Guild. For a small fee, we can give you peace of mind!<br>
Anything stored here can be recovered at any time by you or an authorized agent. What do you think?<br>
