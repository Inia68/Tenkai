<body>Head Blacksmith Kusto:<br>
I'm Head Blacksmith Kusto of the Black Anvil Guild here in Gludin. Unlike the Iron Gate Guild, our Black Anvil Guild is
interested in more than simply profit. The joy in creating something beautiful should sometimes take precedence over the
prospect of a few gold coins, don't you think? Isn't it worthwhile if my skills can bring happiness into another's life?<br>
Ah, but what has brought you to me, friend? I'll gladly provide what help I can.<br>
