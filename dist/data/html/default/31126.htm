<body>Blacksmith of Mammon:<br>
May Mammon bless you! I, the Blacksmith of Mammon, have come to offer you arms of the highest quality.<br>
I shall mend your weapons and armor with skills that no novice blacksmith could ever hope to imitate.<br>
There is one thing I must tell you, however. We dwarves of Mammon didn't deal in coins of the outside world before, but
now we do. And remember that you can only remove seals from A-grade items with village blacksmiths now. I can also
change the status of Bound items. However, you'll need to provide an Unbinding Scroll in order for me to attempt the
work.<br>
