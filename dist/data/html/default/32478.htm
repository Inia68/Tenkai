            <br1>You can retrieve a Dimensional Item that you have bought from the L2 Galleria.
                <br1>If your inventory weight is 80% or more and/or you do not have enough room in your inventory, you
                    will not be able to retrieve your Dimensional Item. Please be careful as some items can't be traded
                    once you have claimed them!
