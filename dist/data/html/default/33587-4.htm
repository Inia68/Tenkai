<body>Mentor Guide:<br>By becoming a mentor, you can apply strong buffs to your mentee.
<br1>However, if the mentor and mentee are too far apart, it will be difficult to apply this skill. To resolve this
    issue, the mentee has a skill to summon the mentor. <br>Please refer to the clan / hero / mentoring skill categories
    in the skill window.
