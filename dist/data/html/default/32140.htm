<body>Vice Hierarch Zenya:<br>I am Kamael Vice Hierarch Zenya. Once, I helped train young Kamael warriors and saw them
off on their travels. However, after the Kamael homeland was destroyed by Shilen, I left the town and became a wanderer.
<br>
Please remember this: Shilen will bring destruction upon us. Her evil plots must be stopped at all costs.<br>
