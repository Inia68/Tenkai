<body>Adventure Guildsman:<br>Welcome, Adventurer!<br>You have completed a most difficult battle, and I was dispatched
from the Adventurer Guild to offer you help. Do you have a Mark of Seal of an Adventurer? If you have marks, I will
exchange them for seals, some of which can be exchanged for useful items. Remember, I can only carry out one exchange
per person.<br>I only accept "Adventurerâ€™s Mark - Loyalty." If you have other marks or seals, you will have to find
another guildsman.<br><br>
