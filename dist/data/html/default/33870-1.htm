It seems you reached your limit when the power of the ancient giants conflicted with your own.<br>
If you receive the Power of Chaos, you will be able to strike a balance between the two powers and get back a potential
power.<br>
Be cautious with your decision as you will never be able to receive the Power of Chaos again due to physical limits.<br>
But know that you can receive it one more time if you have <font color="LEVEL">Chaos Essence</font>.<br>

(You will grow into a specialized awakened class and you won't be able to change it back.)
