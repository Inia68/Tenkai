Who are you? Do you want to experience the wrath of my spirit?<br>Hmm... You don't look like the enemy. Be glad. You
would've been beat to death by my spirits.<br>I'm busy protecting this stronghold. What do you want? I've been taking a
break, since the Embryo are so scared of me and have been trying to escape.<br>Well, since you helped me regain the
stronghold, I'll give you a little something.<br>
