You can evolve your pet depending on its type. Evolution is available only when the pet is summoned, and since it
transfers XP, the level might decrease when you evolve a pet with a high level. <br>
The name of the pet will remain, and the items in the pet inventory will be transferred to the owner's inventory. <br>
Which pet do you want to evolve? <br>
