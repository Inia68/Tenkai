Subclass Master Raina:<br>
<br>


You haven't completed the Mimir's Elixir quest as of yet.<br>

In order to create a subclass, you will need to <font color="LEVEL">complete 'Mimir's Elixir' quest</font>. To learn
more about this quest, see Magister Ladd at the Ivory Tower in Oren.<br>
But if you're a Kamael, you need to <font color="LEVEL">complete the "Seeds of Chaos" instead of "Mimir's
    Elixir."</font> To learn more about this quest, see Kekropus in the Museum on Talking Island.<br>

Ah, before you undertake "Mimir's Elixir" you must first complete the "Fate's Whisper" quest. You can receive this quest
from Maestro Reorin who lives in a cabin in the east of the Town of Oren.<br>
