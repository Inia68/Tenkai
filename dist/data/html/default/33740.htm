<body>Merchant of Mammon:<br>
May Mammon's blessings be upon you! Mammon's guild is here to present our special collection of rare items.<br>
Before you start shopping, thre's a few things you should know. While we dealt only in Ancient Adena in the past, now we
take Adena like any other merchant. Also, you must bring a <font color="LEVEL">Blank Scroll</font> if you plan to
purchase an Enchant Scroll. If you bring us Soul Crystal Fragments, we can make them into whole Soul Crystals. We also
have <font color="LEVEL">Elcyum</font> upgrade items. And don't forget to check out our Augmenting Stones!.<br>
Remember, local tax rates apply! <br>
