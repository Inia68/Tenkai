There's nothing in this world that's completely useless. Have you ever heard of this phrase? "The worth of a something
is what others are willing to give for it." Hahaha! I'm right, aren't I?
<br1>At the moment, we need to rebuild the ravaged areas. All sorts of junk that nobody gave a second look have now
    become important materials for rebuilding, and everyone wants them. So if you bring me odds and ends you have no use
    for, I'll give you Treasure Boxes of Fortune in exchange that may hold something useful for you. Oh, there's also a
    little fee you must pay, but it's no big deal....<br>
    What are odds and ends? Just look inside your inventory. You may even have some now. Things like animal skins, tree
    branches, charcoal, varnish, and cords, you know?<br>
